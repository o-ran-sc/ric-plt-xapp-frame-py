      "message": "An xAPP which is a receive only application might not have a route table and/or route manager might not send a route table because it will have nothing to send.  If this is the case rmr_ready() will never return true; rmr_ready() is really \"ready to send, we have a valid route table\".   An application can receive as soon as rmr_init() completes.  \n\nAn application can prevent this by ensuring that there is a valid (empty) seed route table, but it seems a more elegant solution would be to allow the application to skip the ready check:  wait4ready\u003dTrue in the param list?",
