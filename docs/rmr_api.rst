RMR
====

Overview
--------
The xapp framework repo includes a python submodule called `rmr`.
This package (`ricxappframe.rmr`) is a CTYPES wrapper around the C rmr library.
Most Xapp users will never use this package natively; however python apps that need access to the low level rmr API can use this package.
Usage of this python package requires that you have the c rmr libraries installed.
