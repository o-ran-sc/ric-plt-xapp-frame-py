RIC Alarm API
=============

Overview
--------

The xapp python framework package includes a python subpackage called
`Alarm`.  This subpackage (`ricxappframe.alarm`) provides objects and
methods for defining and raising alarms, which are transmitted using
the RMR shared library.

Usage of this python package requires that the RMR shared-object
library is installed in a system library that is included in the
directories found by default, usually something like /usr/local/lib.
