If we now move com/pylog code under xapp-frame-py repo, are we going to still publish individual pip packages to the pypi.org for the both mdclogpy and xapp-frame-py and both having their own version numbers?\nhttps://pypi.org/project/mdclogpy/\nhttps://pypi.org/project/ricxappframe/\nOr are going to publish only ricxappframe pip package what includes also mdclog?",
