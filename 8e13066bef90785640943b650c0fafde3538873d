      "message": "Not an issue right now since in a loop we only handle rmr msgs and configuration changes but maybe in the future if we need to add more logic inside the while loop, we should refactored it so that we move rmr handling to own function like configuration reading and inside the while loop we just calls these functions in try-catch block. ..just to keep the content of the while loop more readable..\nOtherwise code looks good to me and I have no other comments.",
