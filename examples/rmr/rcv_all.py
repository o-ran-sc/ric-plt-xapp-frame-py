#   Mnemonic:   rcv_all.py
#   Abstract:   This example shows how to receive all queued messages into
#               a bunch (an array of summaries).  RMR is initialised in multi-
#               threaded call mode so that it will queue messages on a 2K ring
#               and prevent the remote application(s) from blocking if we don't
#               do timely receives.  Then we read 'bursts' of messages sleeping
#               between reads to allow some message to pile up.
#
#               Because this programme does not send messages, there is no reason
#               to wait for RMR to initialise a route table (no call to rmr_ready
#               is needed.
